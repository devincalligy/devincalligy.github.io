I recently confirmed that I'll never be able to dunk a basketball.  Not that I've ever really tried before. Its just that recently I looked up at a basketball hoop and, I don't know if you have see how high those rims are, but it's just not possible at 5'8 unless someone holds me up to it like a baby. 

It sucks. 

much love,
