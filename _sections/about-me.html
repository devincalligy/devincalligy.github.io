<p>Hi, my name is Devin Calligy. I can do things. I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in History. I've learned a couple of other things outside from schooling. My hobbies include: learning about tech, coding, reading good books, writing, and making music. I'm creative, quick to learn, and adaptable.  I'm fluent in Spanish and can speak Japanese at an elementary level.  </p>

<p>I'd like to think I'm well rounded and versatile. I've spent my whole life working on this stuff and things I'll forget to list. </p>

<p>I want to learn forever.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm pretty good at video games and sports. And, Napol√©on Bonaparte is my favorite historical figure.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
